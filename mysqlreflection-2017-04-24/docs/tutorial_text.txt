Hello,
MySQLReflection is a PHP utility for auto generating PHP classes source code for
all tables from a given MySQL Database.

A generated class can compute CRUD operations against a MySQL Table.

You can download it from:

1) github      -> https://github.com/rcarvello/mysqlreflection
2) phpclasses  -> https://www.phpclasses.org/package/10162

Now I show you how it works... it is very simple:

1) To set your database modify mysqlreflection.config.php
2) Then, just run app_create_beans.php.
 (In this demo I used the "bean_db" database. See sql\bean_db.sql and install
  it into your local MySQL server)

After running the utility you will find all generated classes into beans
subfolders.

Note:
- Auto generated classes are prefixed with "Bean".
- Each auto generated classes uses bean\bean.config.php for configuration info.
- Each auto generated classes uses Model.php and MySqlRecord.php
