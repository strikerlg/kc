<h1>MySQL Reflection</h1>
<h2>A useful utility for the Object Relation Mapping of MySQL databases.</h2>
The utility generates automatically Model classes for any tables of a given database
schema.<br>
An auto generated MySQL class provides the following services:<br>
<ul>
    <li>A constructor for managing a fetched tableâ€™s row or for a adding a new one</li>
    <li>Management for both single or composite Primary Keys</li>
    <li>Automatic mapping of the different date formats may occurs between
        application and database</li>
    <li>Destructor to automatically close database connection</li>
    <li>Defines a set of attributes corresponding to the table fields</li>
    <li>Setter and Getter methods for each attribute</li>
    <li>OO methods for simplify DML select, insert, update and delete operations</li>
    <li>A facility for quickly updating a previously fetched row</li>
    <li>Useful methods to obtain table DDL and the last executed SQL statement</li>
    <li>Error handling of SQL statements</li>
    <li>Camel/Pascal case naming convention for Attributes/Class used for mapping
        Fields/Table</li>
    <li>Useful PHPDOC information about table, fields and the usage of class,
        attributes and methods.</li>
</ul>
Developers can quickly use these classes on their application.<br>
Into the beans directory are located some auto generated classes of a MySQL schema.<br>
DDL for MySQL schema is into a script file located into "sql" directory.<br>
